Wait, I need to reconsider this. Looking at the modified files `game.js` and `index.html`, these are just source files without any build artifacts, dependencies, or temporary files in the change list. According to rule #6, if the change list contains only source or config files and no build artifacts, dependencies, or temp files, I should output an empty .gitignore.
